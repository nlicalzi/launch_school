### Summary

### Notes

* **Introduction**
  * JavaScript has **first-class functions** which means they can be added to objects, executed in the context of those objects, removed from the objects, passed to other functions, and run in entirely different contexts.
  * First-class functions have no initial context, they receive one when the program executes them.
