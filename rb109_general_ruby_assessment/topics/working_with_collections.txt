# Working with Collections (Arrays, Hashes, Strings)

Commonly used iterative methods (what does each accomplish?):
  - each (iteration)
  - select (selection)
  - map (transformation)

Calling methods with a block on Ruby collection objects:
  - Remember: return value of the block is passed to the method on each iteration
  - What does the method do with the block's return value?
  - What is the ultimate return value of the method?
  - What side effects might the code in the block have? (for ex: mutation)

What to keep in mind about methods that work on collections:
  - What is the method's return value?
  - How does the method use a block's return value, if it takes a block?
  - Is the method destructive?

Looping iteration:
  - 4 basic elements: loop, counter, value retrieval, and loop exiting
  - Difference between loop/do and do/while loops?
    - do/while executes the block at least once
