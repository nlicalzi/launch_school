# Notes on exercises done in preparation for RB109 assessment

How can we split a string 'str' into an array of chunks of length 'sz'?
  - str.scan(/.{#{sz}}/)
  - str.each_slice(sz)
  - str.gsub(/.{1,#{sz}}/)

How can we rotate an array to the left two places?
  - arr.rotate(2)

How can we rotate an array to the right one place?
  - arr.rotate(-1)

How can we loop increment an integer by 1 until a condition is satisfied?
  - int += 1 until int == y (or other such condition)

How can we decompose an integer to an array of its individual digits?
  - int.digits

How can we create a max integer by sorting the digits in a given integer?
  - int.digits.sort.reverse.join.to_i

How can we filter an input string to only alphabetical characters (case insensitive?)
  - str.scan(/[a-z]/i).join

How can we sort an input string, case insensitively?
  - str.sort_by(&:downcase)

What is the difference between indexed element access in strings and arrays?
  - element access in strings returns a new string, while in arrays it's a reference to the object at that position

How can we optimize recursive solutions for memory and runtime?
  - Utilize tail recursion (recursion w/ extra accumulator args)

How can we find the largest/smallest sentence by word count in an array of sentences?
  - sentences.max_by { |sentence| sentence.split.size }
  - sentences.min_by { |sentence| sentence.split.size }
