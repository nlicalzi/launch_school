Encapsulation:
  - Hiding pieces of functionality, making them unavailable to rest of code base.
  - Form of data protection, so that it can't be manipulated or changed without intention.
Polymorphism:
  - The ability for data to be represented as many different types.
Inheritance:
  - When a class inherits the behaviors of another class (the superclass).
Superclass:
  - A class from which a given class inherits behaviors.
  - Usually basic classes with large reusability.
Subclass:
  - Smaller subclasses typically contain more fine-grained, detailed behaviors.
Mixin:
  - Modules may be "mixed-in" with classes using the `include` method invocation.
  - This allows class and its objects access to the behaviors declared in that module.
