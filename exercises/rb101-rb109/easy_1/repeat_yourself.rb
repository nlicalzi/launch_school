# Question: Write a method that takes two arguments, a string and a positive integer, and prints the string as many times as the integer indicates.

# P: 
#   Method accepts two arguments
#     One argument is a string
#     One argument is a positive integer
#   Print `string` `integer` times
# 
# Should we assume that integers are clean? Always string first and then positive int?

# E: 
#   repeat('Hello', 3)
#   repeat('Hello', 0)
#   repeat('', 3)
#   repeat('Hello')
#   repeat(3)
#   repeat(0, 'Hello')
#   repeat(2, 3, 'Hello')
#   repeat('Hello', -3)

# D: 
#   We will ingest one string and one integer
#   We will print a string, x times

# A:
#
