## JS215/Lesson 3: A General Problemsolving Approach



### What to Focus On

### Summary

### Notes

* The PEDAC Problem Solving Process
  * What are the steps in PEDAC?
    * Understand the **P**roblem
      * Make any requirements explicit
      * Convert implicit knowledge to explicit (i.e. "what century is that")
      * Identify and define important terms and concepts
      * Ask the interviewer questions to clarify/verify understanding
    * **E**xamples/Test Cases
      * Help you understand the problem and verify your solution
      * Edge cases: input type, emptiness, boundary conditions, case, duplication
    * **D**ata Structure and **A**lgorithm
      * Data Structure
        * What is the datatype of our input data?
        * What is the outcome required, and how can we manipulate our input?
      * Algorithm
        * Describe the algorithm in the language of your chosen data structure
        * Use: String/Regex, Array, & Hash/Object methods
    * **C**ode
* FAQ on the First Two Steps of the PEDAC Process
  * Steps to Understanding the Problem: *I/O Values*, *Definitions*, *Rules*
  * Two main types of test cases: generic (typical) cases and edge cases.
* Create Examples / Test Cases
* Work with Data Structures and Algorithms
* Translate Algorithm Steps into Code
* Run Test Cases to Verify and Debug Code
