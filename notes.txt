make sure to switch tab size to 2 and translate tabs to spaces to 'true' in text editor when dealing with ruby
use "ruby [ruby file]" to run ruby code from terminal
use "irb" to start the interactive ruby REPL

RUBY STYLING SECTION

ruby uses 2 space indentation, and no tabs
commented lines start with a #
methods, variables, and files should use snake case (which_looks_like_this [all lower, _ separator])
CONSTANTS are declared with UPPERCASE (ex. FOUR = 'four', FIVE = 5)
do...end blocks that fit on one line should be wrapped in curly braces
    ex. [1, 2, 3].each { |i| #do stuff}
ClassNames should be declared with CamelCase (ex. MyFirstClass, MySecondClass)
