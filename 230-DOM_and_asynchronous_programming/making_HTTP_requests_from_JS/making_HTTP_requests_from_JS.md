## JS230 Lesson 3: Making HTTP Requests from JavaScript

### Summary

### Notes

* What to Focus On
  * **Think HTTP**
    * HTTP is the protocol used by the network operations we cover in this lesson. You must be familiar with the request-response cycle, the components of each part, and how you can access these values from JS.
  * **Be Familiar with `XMLHttpRequest`**
    * Know how to use `XMLHttpRequest` to send requests and how to execute code at specific points as the request moves through its lifecycle.
    * Know how to handle successful and unsuccessful requests.
  * **Understand how to Serialize Data**
    * Know how to use `XMLHttpRequest` to submit a form from a webpage and send requests using JSON-formatted data.
  * **Decompose Functionality into API Requests**
    * While each API is different, you should be able to translate a requirement that says "create a post on the server" into "make a POST request to `/posts` with the required JSON data" and be able to write the code that does it.
  * **Read API Documentation**
    * Don't try to memorize the details of the web APIs that we discuss. Try instead to internalize the conventions you see and learn to find the specifics in the documentation.

________

* Book: Working with Web APIs
  * See notes in `launch_school/open_book_shelf`

________

* Network Programming in JavaScript
  * **AJAX** / **A**synchronoux **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML enables developers to fetch data (typically HTML or XML) and update specific parts of a page. 
    * "An AJAX request" or "via AJAX" refers to an HTTP request from a browser that *does not perform a full page load*.
  * Single Page Applications
    * A **single page application** runs entirely within a single HTML page: instead of fetching bits of HTML generated by a server, this model does all interactions by passing data to and from the server, often encoded as JSON.

________

* Making a Request with `XMLHttpRequest` (XHR)

  * We use the `XMLHttpRequest` object to send an HTTP request with JavaScript.

    * This is provided as part of the browser API, not the JS language.

    * ```javascript
      let request = new XMLHttpRequest(); // Instantiate new XHR object
      request.open('GET', '/path');				// Set HTTP method and URL on request
      request.send();											// Send request
      
      // Before the request completes:
      request.responseText; // => ""
      request.status; 			// => 0
      request.statusText; 	// => ""
      
      // After the request completes:
      request.responseText; // body of response
      request.status; 			// status code of response
      request.statusText;		// status text of response
      request.getResponseHeader('Content-Type'); // response header
      ```

    * `request.send` is asynchronous, so code execution continues while it executes in background.

      * ```javascript
        // wait for response by listening for the `load` event
        request.addEventListener('load', event => {
          var request = event.target; 	// the XMLHttpRequest object
          
          request.responseText;
          request.status;
          request.statusText;
          
          request.getResponseHeader('Content-Type');
          request.readyState;
        });
        ```

  * An Overview of `XMLHttpRequest` Methods

    * `open(method, url)`: open a connection to `url` using `method`
    * `send(data)`: send the request, optionally sending along `data`
    * `setRequestHeader(header, value)`: set HTTP `header` to `value`
    * `abort()`: cancel an active request
    * `getResponseHeader(header)`: return the response's value for `header`

  * Particularly Useful `XMLHttpRequest` Properties

    | Property       | Writable | Default Value | Description                                                  |
    | :------------- | :------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `timeout`      | Yes      | `0`           | Maximum time a request can take to complete (in milliseconds) |
    | `readyState`   | No       |               | What state the request is in (see below)                     |
    | `responseText` | No       | `null`        | Raw text of the response's body.                             |
    | `response`     | No       | `null`        | Parsed content of response, *not meaningful in all situations* |

  * Problems

    * ```javascript
      var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
      request.open('GET', 'https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails');
      request.send();
      
      request.responseText; // response body
      ```

_________

* `XMLHttpRequest` Events
  * Two main events fire during an `XMLHttpRequest` cycle: 
    * `loadstart`: request sent to server
    * `loadend`: response done loading and all other events have fired (last event to fire)
  * Before `loadend` fires, an event will fire based on whether the request was successful:
    * `load`: a complete response loaded
    * `abort`: the request was interrupted before it could complete
    * `error`: an error occured
    * `timeout`: a response wasn't received before the timeout period ended

  * The application code itself is responsible for determining whether a `request` was successful by inspecting the response within a `load` event handler.

* Cross-Domain `XMLHttpRequests` with CORS
