## JS230 Lesson 3: Making HTTP Requests from JavaScript

### Summary

### Notes

* What to Focus On
  * Think HTTP
    * HTTP is the protocol used by the network operations we cover in this lesson. You must be familiar with the request-response cycle, the components of each part, and how you can access these values from JS.
  * Be Familiar with `XMLHttpRequest`
    * Know how to use `XMLHttpRequest` to send requests and how to execute code at specific points as the request moves through its lifecycle.
    * Know how to handle successful and unsuccessful requests.
  * Understand how to Serialize Data
    * Know how to use `XMLHttpRequest` to submit a form from a webpage and send requests using JSON-formatted data.
  * Decompose Functionality into API Requests
    * While each API is different, you should be able to translate a requirement that says "create a post on the server" into "make a POST request to `/posts` with the required JSON data" and be able to write the code that does it.
  * Read API Documentation
    * Don't try to memorize the details of the web APIs that we discuss. Try instead to internalize the conventions you see and learn to find the specifics in the documentation.
