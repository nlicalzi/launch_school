## 230/Lesson 5: Putting it All Together

### Summary

### Notes

* **Chrome Debugging Tools for Front End Development**
  * Good to use `console.log({pets})` instead of `console.log(pets)` -- **object shorthand syntax**
    * Difference between logging `(3) [{...}, {...}, {...}]` and `{pets: Array(3)}`
    * `console.table(pets)` will print a properly formatted table of your object/values
  * Learn to debug with the `Sources` panel
    * Better suited for tricky bugs
    * Keeping track of code execution order
      * Code stepping
      * Call stack
      * Code Folding
    * Keeping track of values
      * Values printed inline after a line of code executes
      * Scope pane
      * Run JS contextually in the Drawer
      * [Live Expressions](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/live-expressions)
      * [Logpoints](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/breakpoints): `DOM`, `XHR`, `Event-listener`, `Function`, all in addition to normal `line-of-code`
      * Storing the output of Logpoints as global variables
