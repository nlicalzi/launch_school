## LS230: DOM and Asynchronous Programming with JS

### Summary

In this course, we'll begin to draw from what we've mastered in the HTML/CSS course and the JS courses and learn how to add behavior to our user interfaces with JS. We'll start by learning about the DOM and how it lets developers change a document. In the lessons that follow, we'll see how to update the interface in response to actions triggered by the user or the browser. We'll also explore `XMLHttpRequest`, one of the browser APIs that provide network programming functionality to JS applications. We'll discuss how we can leverage third party libraries, such as jQuery, to simplify certain aspects of front-end development. Finally, we'll put all of those topics together to work on a number of projects.
