### Summary

### Notes

* **The Document Object Model (DOM)**
  * The Document Object Model is an in-memory object representation of an HTML document. It provides a way to interact with a web page using JS and provides the functionality needed to build modern interactive user experiences.
  * CSS-Tricks Article:
    * When you're looking at the panel in whatever DevTools you are using that shows you stuff that looks like HTML, that is a visual representation of the DOM.
    * The DOM *can differ* from the source HTML-- maybe the browser has fixed some mistakes in your code (omitting a tag, for example), but more likely it will differ because **JS can manipulate the DOM**.
      * AJAX can do this, client side templating can do this, etc.
    * A lot of what JS does in the browser is actually **manipulating the DOM API**.
    * **W3's Technical Definition**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML And well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. 
  * **Wikipedia's Technical Definition**: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects.
    * DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style, or content of a document.
    * Nodes can have *event handlers* attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handler gets executed.
