### What to Focus On

* Always remember to **test and validate** your pages
  1. Update your code
  2. Test the results in your browser
  3. Validate your HTML
  4. Validate your CSS
  5. **Check your page on other browsers**
* **VOCABULARY**
  * The Box Model
    * Box properties: width and height, padding and margins, and borders
    * Visual display models: `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`
    * Box sizing model: `content-box` and `border-box`
  * Dimensions: absolute units and relative units
* **Box Properties**
  * Every box has a width, height, padding, border, and margins; know the differences.
  * Padding, borders, and margins have separate properties to set the left, right, top, and bottom of each element. You can use shortcut properties to specify all four sides at once.
  * How does the visual display model interact with margins, borders, and padding?
* **Visual Display Models**
  * Understand the differences between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`.
  * Containers are almost always `block` elements, while non-containers are `inline`. When in doubt, check MDN.
  * Don't try to memorize which HTML elements are `block` or `inline`.
  * How and when can you change an element's visual display model?
* **Box Sizing Models**
  * Understand the `content-box` and `border-box` sizing models.
  * How and when can you change the box-sizing model for an element?
* **Dimensions**
  * Know the differences between `px`, `em`, `rem`, `%`, and `auto`.
  * Understand why we need to talk about CSS reference pixels and physical pixels. Don't try to memorize the details, but understand the topic well enough that you won't be too surprised the first time you encounter the differences in the wild.
  * Use `auto` margins to center block elements horizontally.
* **CSS**
  * Become comfortable with the CSS `display`, `box-sizing`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border`, and `margin` properties. Memorize this list of properties so you can look up the details when needed.
