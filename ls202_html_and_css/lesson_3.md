## LS202/Lesson 3: Images

### Resources
### What to Focus On

This lesson focuses on images and how Web pages use them. We'll focus on the different image types and talk about the roles they play in HTML documents.

* Image Types
  * Understand the primary differences between jpg, png, and gif images
  * Explain when to use each image type
* HTML and CSS for Images
  * Add foreground and background images to a web page
  * Use figures and captions
  * Use images as links

### Notes

* Image Types
  * JPG
    * Use a **lossy** form of compression: they lose information in exchange for a file size reduction.
    * Each time a JPG is edited, the resulting file has less detail (more **artifacts**) than the original.
  * PNG
    * PNG compression is non-lossy, so the file sizes are bigger.
    * Provide both single-color and alpha transparency, useful for logos, icons, and line drawings.
    * Often the best choice for backgrounds and non-photographic images that need all their detail or transparency.
  * GIF
    * Suitable for small images used as user interface icons in an application.
    * Have limited color range (256 colors), allowing for very small file sizes.
