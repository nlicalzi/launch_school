## Vocab covered in "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts

* Shell
* Terminal emulator
* Shell prompt
* Command history
* Hierarchical directory structure
  * A tree-like pattern of directories branching out from a root directory.
* Directory
  * Can be thought of as a 'folder', which may contain files or other directories.
* Root Directory
  * The first directory in a hierarchical directory structure.
* Home Directory
* Current Working Directory
* Absolute Pathname
  * A pathname that begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.
* Relative Pathname
  * A pathname that starts from the current working directory that uses the special notations `.` and `..`  to represent relative positions in the file system tree.
    * `.` refers to the current working directory. (Note: we can almost always omit `./`, because generally if a pathname to something is not specified, the working directory will be assumed. )
    * `..` refers to the parent directory of the current working directory.
