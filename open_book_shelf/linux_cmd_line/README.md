* **Part 1 - [Learning the Shell](learning_the_shell.md)**
  * This section starts our exploration of the basic language of the command line including such things as the structure of commands, file system navigation, command line editing, and finding help and documentation for commands.
* **Part 2 - Configuration and the Environment**
  * This section covers editing configuration files that control the computer's operation from the command line.
* **Part 3 - Common Tasks and Essential Tools**
  * This section explors many of the ordinary tasks that are commonly performed from the command line. Unix-like operation systems, such as Linnux, contain many "classic" command line programs that are used to perform powerful operations on data.
* **Part 4 - Writing Shell Scripts**
  * This section introduces shell programming, an admittedly rudimentary, but easy to learn, technique for automating many common computing tasks. By learning shell programming, you will become familiar with concepts that can be applied to many other programming languages.
