# LS210: Fundamentals of JavaScript for Programmers

### Summary

This course is an Introduction to JavaScript for those who have already programmed in another language. Since familiarity with another language is assumed, this course will focus more on the specifics of the JavaScript language than on programming in general. This course covers the following:

- Language grammar, syntax and data types
- Functions and higher-order functions
- Arrays and Objects as data structures
- Core built-in methods
- Writing idiomatic and stylistic code

Even though the course is not problem-solving focused, it comes with a rich set of practice problems to help you solidify your understanding of new JavaScript constructs.
