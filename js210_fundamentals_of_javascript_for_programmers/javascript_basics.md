## JS210/Lesson 1: JavaScript Basics

### What to Focus On

This course is an Introduction to JavaScript for those who have already programmed in another language. Since you already know the fundamentals of programming, this course will focus more on the specifics of the JavaScript language than on programming in general. This course covers the following:

* Language grammar, syntax, and data types
* Functions and higher-order functions
* Arrays and Objects as data structures
* Core built-in methods
* Writing idiomatic and stylistic code

### Summary

### Notes

* JavaScript Versions
  * Current JS spect is ECMAScript 2019 (or ES10)
  * ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) represented a huge improvement, so modern JS is known as ES6+
  * Use a compatability table to determine what browsers support what features:
    * http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es2016plus/
  * Or use a tool like Babel to transpile modern JS to run in older browsers:
    * https://babeljs.io/
  * Chrome generally adopts new features fastest, then Firefox then MSFT.
