## Lesson 2: Database-backed Web Applications

#### What to Focus On

* **What schema does an application require?**
  * Being able to map the data used by a project to a database schema is an important skill.
* **Project setup is secondary**
  * We do a lot of configuration in this lesson to get the application connecting to a database, logging out queries, etc. You aren't expected to be able to do these things off the top of your head-- they are great examples of concepts you should be aware of, but can easily look up if and when you need to implement them.
