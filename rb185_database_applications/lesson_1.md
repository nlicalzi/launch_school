## Lesson 1: Interacting with a Database in Code

#### What to Focus On

* Observe the progression of steps from high-level requirements to low-level implementation details
  * Think about how project requirements affect what SQL is written later.
* Understand how to dynamically generate SQL
  * We'll be creating SQL statements from Ruby. There are risks associated with this practice, so pay special attention to how this can be done safely.
* Focus on the database and not the application
  * We're building a command-line application in this lesson, but this aspect of the project hsould be considered secondary to its database interaction functionality.
