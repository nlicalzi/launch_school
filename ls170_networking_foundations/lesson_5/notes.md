## LS170 Lesson 5: Transport Layer Security (TLS)



### Overview

1. Intro (Why TLS?)
   * HTTP is a text based protocol, transferred across the network in plain text.
   * HTTP is fairly simple, with a basic message structure and set of rules.
   * These characteristics make it easy to design and build with, but make it insecure
     * Easy to read contents of an HTTP message if it's intercepted.
     * Hard to verify if the source of an HTTP message is trustworthy.
     * Hard to know if an HTTP message has been tampered with in transit.
