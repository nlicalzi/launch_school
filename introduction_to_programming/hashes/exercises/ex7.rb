# Exercise 7, Hashes, Intro to Programming, Launch School

p "Given: "
p "x = 'hi there'"
p "my_hash = {x: 'some value'}"
p "my_hash2 = {x => 'some value'}"

p "The difference between the two hashes is that my_hash has the symbol :x as its key"
p "While my_hash2 has the string value of 'hi there' as its key"
p "This difference matters for performance at scale: :x is smaller in memory than 'hi there'"
