Loop: A *loop* is the repetitive execution of a piece of code for a given amount of repetitions or until a certain condition is met.
  - Some types of loops include: FOR, WHILE, and DO/WHILE loops
  - Loops can be exited with *break*
  - *next* keyword allows you to skip the rest of a loop iteration and go to next
  - *until* loops are the opposite of while loops
  - *for* loop RETURNS collection of elements after execution
  - *while* loop RETURNS nil

Range: not actually a keyword, but called like: 1..5 (works inclusively)
