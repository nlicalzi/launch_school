p "The issue is with trying to set the value of an array item by index, using a string as the key"
p "names['margaret'] is throwing the error. If trying to return the index position, names.index('margaret') would work."
p "However, if we're trying to change the value of an item in an array, the correct syntax would be:"
p "names[3] = 'jody'"
