p "I've enjoyed reading through the materials in '10 minutes to your first Ruby app', " + 
  "which can be found at #{url}. Knowing a bit now about how Ruby syntax works, and " +
  "thanks to how expressive the language is, reading through the documentation for a " +
  "complete, albeit basic, app seems feasible."

p "It's been particularly useful/interesting to read through this tutorial because it deals " +
  "not only with Ruby syntax and interactions, but also with the interactions between Ruby and " +
  "other pieces of the programming ecosystem: making executable Ruby files, the interplay with " +
  "HTML and Javascript, etc. It's a good reminder of what we're building to-- full-stack expertise."
