Flow Control

- "Conditional Flow": making your data do the right thing at the right time
    - Accomplished w/ Conditionals: "if", and operators 
        - [<, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, && (and), || (or), ! (not)], 
        - ["if", "else", "elsif" (NOTE: MISSING E), "end"]

- One liners: if compressing if/end to one line, must use "then"
    - ex. if x == 3 then puts "x is 3" end
    - otherwise it would be:
        if x == 3
            puts "x is 3"
        end
        
    - Puts and If can be rearranged!
        - puts "x is 3" if x == 3
        
    - "Unless" is also a reserved word, meaning !if
        - puts "x is NOT 3" unless x == 3

- Order of precedence: 
    1. <=, <, >, >= - Comparison
    2. ==, != - Equality
    3. && - Logical AND
    4. || - Logical OR
    
- TERNARY OPERATOR
    - Quick, one-line if/else statement, using "?" and ":"
    - ex. true ? "this is true" : "this is not true"
    - Left of : is True
    - Right of : is False
    - Depending on left of ?, either left (true) or right (false) is returned
    
- CASE STATEMENT
    - Similar functionality to "if", but with different interface
    - reserved words "case", "when", "else", and "end"
    
- Every expression evaluates to 'true' in control flow, except 'false' and 'nil'
    ex.:
        if x = 5
            puts "how can this be true?"
        else
            puts "it is not true"
        end
        
    ex.:
        a = 5
        if a
            puts "how can this be true?"
        else
            puts "it is not true"
        end
