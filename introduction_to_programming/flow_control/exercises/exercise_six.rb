# def equal_to_four(x)
#   if x == 4
#     puts "yup"
#   else
#     puts "nope"
# end

# equal_to_four(5)

# The above code returns an "unexpected end-of-input" error because there is only one end statement, despite the presence 
# of both an if...end block and a method definition, which needs its own end block as well. It needs an "end" after line 5
