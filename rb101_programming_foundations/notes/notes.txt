What is the Two-Layer Problem?
    - Learning to solve problems while simultaneously memorizing the syntax of a particular language. 
    - We need instead to simplify so we're not fighting a multi-front battle.
    
How can we get around the Two-Layer Problem?
    - By using PEDAC
    
What does PEDAC stand for?
    - Two objectives: Processing the problem (PEDA) and Coding with intent (C)
    - P: Understanding the Problem
        - Identify expected input and output
        - Make the requirements explicit
        - Identify rules
        - Mental model of the problem
    - E: Examples/Test Case (Validate understanding of the problem)
    - D: Data Structure (How we represent data when converting input to output)
    - A: Algorithm (Steps for converting input to output)
    - C: Code (Implementation of Algorithm) 

Why use PEDAC?
    - Avoiding "hack and slash" coding
        - Often leads to missed requirements, unforeseen edge cases, hard to
          understand code, and code that's difficult to maintain.
