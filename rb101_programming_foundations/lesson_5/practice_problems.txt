Problem 1:
Q: How would you order this array of number strings by descending numeric value?
   arr = ['10', '11', '9', '7', '8']
A:
  arr.sort do |x,y|
    y.to_i <=> x.to_i # element-wise comparison for integers
  end

Problem 2:
Q: How would you order this array of hashes based on the year of publication of
   each book, from the earliest to the latest?

  books = [
    {title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude', author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez', published: '1967'},
    {title: 'The Great Gatsby', author: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', published: '1925'},
    {title: 'War and Peace', author: 'Leo Tolstoy', published: '1869'},
    {title: 'Ulysses', author: 'James Joyce', published: '1922'}
  ]

A:
  books.sort do |x,y|
    x[:published] <=> y[:published]
  end

  OR

  books.sort_by do |book|
    book[:published]
  end
