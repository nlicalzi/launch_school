# Sorting

  - Sorting is mostly performed on arrays, since index is important. Strings don't
    have sorting methods (but can be converted to arrays with String#chars), and
    Hashes are generally accessed using Hash[key], so order mostly doesn't matter.

  - Comparison is at the heart of how sorting works.
    - `<=>`, or the Spaceship operator, lets us compare two elements in an array.
      - Returns a -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the first object is less than,
        equal to, or greater than the second object. If they can't be compared,
        `nil` is returned (throwing an ArgumentError).
          - Does the given object type implement <=> (strings? integers?)
          - What is the specific implementation of the method for the object type?

      - String order is determined by a character's position in the ASCII table.
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Code_chart
        - 'A' (0041) precedes 'a' (0061). String#ord reveals its ASCII position.
        - `Digits` / `(most) punctuation` precede `UPPERCASE` precedes `lowercase`

  - Array#sort
    - Argument error if two elements aren't of comparable type (string vs. int)
    - Can be called with a block. Ex:
      - DEFAULT IMPLEMENTATION:
        [2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort { |a, b| a <=> b }
          => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            - Using Integer#<=> to sort.
      - DESCENDING SORT:
        [2, 5, 3, 4, 1].sort { |a, b| b <=> a }
          => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

    - String#<=> compares multi-character strings char by char (character-wise):
      - "ants" <=> "arc" ==> +1
      - "cape" <=> "cap" ==> -1

    - Array#<=> compares arrays element by element (element-wise):
      - ["a", "car", "d"] <=> ["a", "car", "d", 3] ==> +1

  - Array#sort_by
    - Usually called with a block, determining how the items are compared.

    ['cot', 'bed', 'mat'].sort_by { |word| word[1] } # sort by second letter
      => ["mat", "bed", "cot"]

  - Hash#sort_by
    - Always returns an array, call Array#to_h to convert back to hash if desired
    - Requires key and value to be passed to the block when called. Ex:

      people = { Kate: 27, john: 25, Mike:  18 }
      people.sort_by do |_, age|
        age
      end
        => [[:Mike, 18], [:john, 25], [:Kate, 27]]

  - Other methods also use <=> for comparisons:
    - #min, #max, #minmax, #min_by, #max_by, #minmax_by
      - All inherited from the Enumerable module (included in Array and Hash)

# Nested Data Structures

# VOCAB
  - Spaceship operator (<=>)
  - ASCII Table

# METHODS
  - String#ord
  - Array#sort
  - Array#sort_by
  - Hash#sort_by
  - String#<=>, Numeric#<=>
