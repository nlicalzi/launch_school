# Temperament
  - The key to debugging is having a patient and logical temperament.

# Reading Error Messages
  - *Stack Trace*: every language/library has a certain pattern to theirs.

# Steps to Debugging
  1. Reproduce the Error
  2. Determine the Boundaries of the Error
  3. Trace the Code (or, 'Trapping the Error')
  4. Understand the Problem Well
  5. Implement a Fix (fix one problem at a time!)
  6. Test the Fix (add additional automated tests now)

# Techniques for Debugging
  1. Line by line
  2. Rubber Duck Debugging
  3. Walking Away
  4. Using Pry
