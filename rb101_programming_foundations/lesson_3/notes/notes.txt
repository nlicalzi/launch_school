#gsub! for replacing substrings in strings

Hash#assoc for collecting key/value pair where key matches argument

How can we test if a key is included in a hash? (Hash#has_key? / Hash#include? / Hash#key?)

Hash#merge will interleave new key/value pairs to a hash

String#index will return the left-index of a substring, use w/ String#slice

I should consider making cards for various methods on String, Hash, Array, Numeric, etc...
