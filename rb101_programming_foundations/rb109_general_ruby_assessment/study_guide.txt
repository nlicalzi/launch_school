     - distinction between 'true' and 'truthy'
     - every value but nil and false is 'truthy' in Ruby
  - Method definition
    - Method definition is when we define a Ruby method using the 'def' keyword
      - in method definition, we can add *parameters* to the method
    - because of scope gating/encapsulation, methods can only access local
      variables if they are passed in as parameters
  - Method invocation
    - Method invocation is when we call a method
      - in method invocation, we can pass *arguments* to the method.
      - Remember: caller.method(args) {block}
    - Method invocation with a block has different scoping / encapsulation rules
  - Implicit return value of method invocations
  - Implicit return value of blocks
