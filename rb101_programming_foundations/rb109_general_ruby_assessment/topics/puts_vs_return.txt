# Puts vs. Return

- Ruby methods always return the evaluated result of the last line of the expression
  unless an explicit return statement comes before it.

## Puts vs. p vs. print

- `Puts` prints something to the screen with a new line at the end
  - the return value of a `puts` call is nil
  - Puts attempts to convert its argument to a string with to_s
  - Each element of an array will get a new line, and nils will be blank lines

- `Print` behaves like puts, except it doesn't add new lines or display objects on new lines

- `p` will show the results of obj.inspect, and add a new line ('rawer' version of object)
  - `p` calls have as their return value the argument object that was passed in
